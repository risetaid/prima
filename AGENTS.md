IMPORTANT:
- Double check the tools installed in the environment before using them.
- Never call a file editing tool for the same file in parallel.
- Always prefer the Grep, Glob and LS tools over shell commands like find, grep, or ls for codebase exploration.
- Always prefer using the absolute paths when using tools, to avoid any ambiguity.
