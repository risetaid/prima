  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  patient_id UUID REFERENCES patients(id),
  medication_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  form TEXT NOT NULL,
  dosage TEXT NOT NULL,
  dosage_value DECIMAL(10,3),
  dosage_unit TEXT NOT NULL,
  frequency TEXT NOT NULL,
  timing TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Medication administration logs
CREATE TABLE medication_administration_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  patient_id UUID REFERENCES patients(id),
