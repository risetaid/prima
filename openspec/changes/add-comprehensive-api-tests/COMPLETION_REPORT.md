## How to Use

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test --run

# Run with coverage
bun test --run --coverage

# Watch mode (auto-run on changes)
bun test

# Open Vitest UI
bun test --ui
```

### Test Organization

- `comprehensive.test.ts` - Main test suite with all 90 tests
- `health.test.ts` - Health check tests
- `core-endpoints.test.ts` - User and core API tests
- `patients.test.ts` - Patient management tests
- `webhooks-fonnte.test.ts` - Fonnte webhook tests

### Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in `tests/api/`
2. Use fixtures from `tests/helpers/mock-fixtures.ts`
3. Use auth mocks from `tests/helpers/auth-mocks.ts`
4. Follow AAA pattern
5. Run `bun test` locally
6. Commit with tests passing

---

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are ready for GitHub Actions integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run tests
  run: bun test --run --coverage

- name: Check coverage
  run: |
    if [ $(coverage_lines) -lt 80 ]; then
      echo "Coverage below 80%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review:** Code review of test suite and documentation
2. **Integrate:** Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
3. **Monitor:** Track coverage metrics in CI pipeline
4. **Extend:** Add new tests as features are developed
5. **Document:** Reference tests in API documentation
