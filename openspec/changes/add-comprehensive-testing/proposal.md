## Why
The PRIMA system currently has no automated tests for its 40+ API endpoints and critical Fonnte webhook handler, making it vulnerable to regressions and making it difficult to verify that changes work correctly. This creates reliability and maintainability risks for a healthcare application handling patient reminders.

## What Changes
- **Test Infrastructure**: Configure Bun test runner with test utilities, mocks, and fixtures for API testing
- **API Tests**: Create comprehensive tests for all 40+ API endpoints (health, patients, reminders, CMS, webhooks, admin endpoints)
- **Webhook Tests**: Implement full coverage for Fonnte incoming webhook handler (message processing, verification, confirmation, idempotency, status updates)
- **Service Tests**: Unit tests for core services (PatientService, ReminderService, VerificationService, etc.)
- **Database Mocks**: Test utilities for database operations without requiring a live database connection during tests

## Impact
- Affected specs: 
  - `testing/api-testing` (new)
  - `testing/webhook-testing` (new)
  - `testing/test-infrastructure` (new)
  - `testing/service-testing` (new)
- Affected code: 
  - `src/app/api/**/*.ts` (all endpoints)
  - `src/services/**/*.ts` (service layer)
  - `tests/` directory (new test files)
  - Package scripts: add `bun test` command support

## Implementation Approach
1. Create test utilities and mock factories
2. Write API endpoint tests with proper request/response validation
3. Implement comprehensive Fonnte webhook tests
4. Add service layer unit tests
5. Verify all tests pass and achieve meaningful coverage
