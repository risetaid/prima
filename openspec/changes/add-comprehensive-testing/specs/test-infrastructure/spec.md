## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Test Framework Configuration
The system SHALL be configured to run automated tests using Bun's test runner.

#### Scenario: Tests are discovered and run
- **WHEN** `bun test` command is executed
- **THEN** all test files are discovered and executed

#### Scenario: Test output includes summary
- **WHEN** tests complete
- **THEN** output includes pass/fail counts, duration, and file list

### Requirement: Mock Service Factories
The system SHALL provide mock implementations of services for isolated testing.

#### Scenario: Mock PatientService is created
- **WHEN** test creates mock patient service
- **THEN** mock service has all required methods with configurable return values

#### Scenario: Mock ReminderService is created
- **WHEN** test creates mock reminder service
- **THEN** mock service has all required methods with configurable return values

#### Scenario: Mock database is available
- **WHEN** test initializes mock database
- **THEN** mock db simulates Drizzle ORM operations without live connection

### Requirement: Test Fixtures and Sample Data
The system SHALL provide realistic sample data for testing.

#### Scenario: Sample patient data is available
- **WHEN** test needs patient fixture
- **THEN** realistic patient object with all required fields is provided

#### Scenario: Sample reminder data is available
- **WHEN** test needs reminder fixture
- **THEN** realistic reminder object with schedule and template data is provided

#### Scenario: Sample template data is available
- **WHEN** test needs template fixture
- **THEN** realistic template object with variables and content is provided

### Requirement: HTTP Request/Response Builders
The system SHALL provide utilities for building test requests and validating responses.

#### Scenario: JSON POST request builder creates valid NextRequest
- **WHEN** test builds POST request with JSON body
- **THEN** request object is compatible with route handlers

#### Scenario: Query parameter builder creates valid request
- **WHEN** test builds GET request with query parameters
- **THEN** request object correctly includes search parameters

#### Scenario: Authorization header builder adds valid token
- **WHEN** test builds authenticated request
- **THEN** request includes valid authorization header

#### Scenario: Response validator checks status and structure
- **WHEN** test validates API response
- **THEN** validator checks HTTP status, JSON format, and required fields

### Requirement: Database Testing Utilities
The system SHALL provide utilities for testing database operations.

#### Scenario: Test database can be initialized
- **WHEN** test initializes database context
- **THEN** mock database is ready with empty state

#### Scenario: Test data can be seeded
- **WHEN** test seeds sample data into mock database
- **THEN** data is available for test assertions

#### Scenario: Database queries can be mocked
- **WHEN** test mocks database query result
- **THEN** subsequent queries return configured mock data

### Requirement: Test Isolation
The system SHALL ensure tests do not affect each other.

#### Scenario: Each test runs in isolated context
- **WHEN** multiple tests run sequentially
- **THEN** state changes in one test do not affect others

#### Scenario: Mock state is reset between tests
- **WHEN** test modifies mock service state
- **THEN** next test receives clean mock state

### Requirement: Async/Await Test Support
The system SHALL properly handle asynchronous operations in tests.

#### Scenario: Async API handler is tested
- **WHEN** test calls async route handler
- **THEN** test properly awaits and validates response

#### Scenario: Promise rejection is caught
- **WHEN** API handler rejects promise
- **THEN** test correctly identifies error

### Requirement: Test Debugging Support
The system SHALL provide utilities for debugging test failures.

#### Scenario: Test can log debug information
- **WHEN** test failure occurs
- **THEN** debug logs provide context about request and response

#### Scenario: Mock call tracking is available
- **WHEN** test needs to verify mock was called
- **THEN** mock provides call count and argument history
