# Testing Infrastructure â€” Spec Delta

**Status:** REMOVED  
**Affected Components:** Configuration, package.json, bunfig.toml, tsconfig.json, tests/ directory

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Test Framework Setup

Previously: Vitest was configured as the test framework via bunfig.toml and installed as a devDependency.
**Removal:** All Vitest configuration and dependencies are completely removed from the project.

#### Scenario: Vitest Configuration Removed

- No `[test]` block exists in `bunfig.toml`
- No Vitest packages listed in `package.json` devDependencies

### Requirement: Test Execution Capability

Previously: `bun test` command was available via Vitest integration configured in bunfig.toml.
**Removal:** Test execution is no longer possible or available in the project.

#### Scenario: Test Command Unavailable

- No test-related scripts in `package.json`
- Running `bun test` fails as expected (test infrastructure removed)

### Requirement: Test File Organization

Previously: Test files were organized in `tests/` directory with subdirectories for fixtures, helpers, integration, and mocks.
**Removal:** The entire `tests/` directory and all its contents are deleted.

#### Scenario: Test Directory Removed

- `tests/` directory does not exist
- No test files (_.test.ts, _.spec.ts) exist in the codebase
- No test fixtures, helpers, or setup files exist

### Requirement: TypeScript Configuration for Tests

Previously: TypeScript configuration explicitly excluded the tests directory to prevent test files from affecting the main build.
**Removal:** The tests exclusion is removed from `tsconfig.json` (though tests directory itself is deleted, so exclusion becomes unnecessary).

#### Scenario: Test Exclusion Removed from TypeScript

- `tsconfig.json` exclude array no longer contains "tests"
- TypeScript configuration treats tests directory as non-existent

### Requirement: Test Preload and Setup

Previously: `tests/setup.ts` was preloaded by Vitest via bunfig.toml `[test]` preload configuration.
**Removal:** Test setup file is deleted and preload configuration is removed.

#### Scenario: Test Setup Removed

- `tests/setup.ts` file does not exist
- No preload configuration in `bunfig.toml`
