# Implementation Plan: Remove Shell Route Group

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-01-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature will restructure the Next.js routing by moving all authenticated pages from the `(shell)` route group to directly under `src/app/`. The primary goal is to simplify the file structure while maintaining all existing functionality, authentication, and URL patterns. This affects 7 major route sections: admin, pasien, pengingat, cms, berita, kredit, and video-edukasi.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+ (inferred from existing project)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, React 19, Clerk Authentication
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (existing)
**Testing**: TypeScript compilation + ESLint (existing pattern)
**Target Platform**: Web application (server-side rendering)
**Project Type**: Web application (single Next.js project)
**Performance Goals**: No performance degradation - page load times must remain unchanged
**Constraints**: Zero downtime, zero breaking changes, all existing URLs must continue working
**Scale/Scope**: Affects 7 major route sections with approximately 20+ pages and nested routes

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Gates from PRIMA Constitution

**Patient-Centered Design (I)**: ✅ PASS - This change improves maintainability which indirectly benefits patient care by reducing bugs and improving development velocity. No impact to patient-facing functionality.

**Data Privacy and Compliance (II)**: ✅ PASS - Authentication and authorization logic will be preserved exactly as before. No changes to data access patterns.

**Reliability and Redundancy (III)**: ⚠️ REQUIRES VERIFICATION - Must ensure that the migration doesn't introduce any reliability issues, especially around authentication flows and error boundaries.

**WIB Timezone Integrity (IV)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to timezone handling logic.

**Service Layer Architecture (V)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to service layer organization; this is purely a routing structure change.

**Type Safety and Validation (VI)**: ✅ PASS - All TypeScript types and validation schemas must remain intact.

**Performance with Caching (VII)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to caching strategies or performance characteristics.

### GATE STATUS: ✅ PASSED WITH REQUIREMENTS
- Must maintain all authentication and authorization patterns exactly
- Must preserve error boundaries and loading states
- No performance degradation allowed
- All existing URLs must continue working

**Structure Decision**: Moving to Option 1 (Single project) with simplified routing structure. The shell layout functionality will be redistributed to individual route layouts or middleware to maintain authentication requirements.

## Phase 0 Complete ✅

**Research Summary**: Comprehensive research conducted on Next.js route group migration patterns, authentication strategies, and layout inheritance preservation.

**Key Decisions**:
- Hybrid authentication approach (middleware + layout-based)
- Incremental migration strategy to ensure zero downtime
- Hierarchical error boundary structure
- Performance optimization through edge-level auth checks

**Artifacts Created**:
- `research.md` - Complete migration strategy and findings
- `data-model.md` - Authentication components and layout structure
- `contracts/routing-contracts.md` - URL preservation and testing requirements
- `quickstart.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

## Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Design Summary**: Complete technical design created including middleware configuration, layout structure, and migration contracts.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Middleware for basic authentication with route protection
- Individual route layouts preserving AuthLoading and error boundaries
- File system migration maintaining all existing URLs
- Comprehensive testing and validation framework

**Artifacts Created**:
- Middleware configuration for route protection
- Individual layout templates for each route section
- Complete file mapping from source to target structure
- Performance and compliance requirements

## Re-evaluated Constitution Check

*Final validation after Phase 1 design*

**Patient-Centered Design (I)**: ✅ PASS - Improved maintainability reduces bugs and improves development velocity, indirectly benefiting patient care.

**Data Privacy and Compliance (II)**: ✅ PASS - Authentication and authorization preserved exactly; middleware provides additional security layer.

**Reliability and Redundancy (III)**: ✅ PASS - Hierarchical error boundaries improve reliability; middleware prevents unauthorized access at edge.

**WIB Timezone Integrity (IV)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to timezone handling.

**Service Layer Architecture (V)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to service layer; purely routing structure change.

**Type Safety and Validation (VI)**: ✅ PASS - All TypeScript types preserved; comprehensive validation in contracts.

**Performance with Caching (VII)**: ✅ PASS - Edge-level auth improves performance; no changes to caching strategies.

### FINAL GATE STATUS: ✅ PASSED
All constitution requirements satisfied with improved security and performance characteristics.

## Complexity Tracking

This feature involves low to medium complexity with comprehensive risk mitigation:

| Aspect | Complexity | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| File movement | Low | Established Next.js patterns, incremental migration |
| Authentication preservation | Low | Hybrid approach with middleware backup |
| Layout inheritance | Low | Automatic Next.js layout inheritance |
| Testing/Validation | Medium | Comprehensive test contracts and validation checklist |

**Risk Assessment**: LOW RISK - Well-established migration patterns with comprehensive testing and rollback procedures.

## Implementation Ready

This feature is now ready for implementation with `/speckit.tasks` command. All research, design, contracts, and documentation are complete and constitutionally compliant.

**Expected Benefits**:
