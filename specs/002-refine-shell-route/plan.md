# Implementation Plan: Refine Shell Route Group Specification

**Branch**: `002-refine-shell-route` | **Date**: 2025-01-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-refine-shell-route/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature will refine the shell route group specification and create a focused implementation plan for eliminating the (shell) route group entirely. The core goal is to move all content from `src/app/(shell)/` directly to `src/app/` while maintaining TypeScript strict mode compliance, preserving all URLs, and ensuring authentication flows work identically. This is a targeted refinement based on analysis feedback to address constitution compliance and simplify success criteria.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+ (inferred from existing project)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, React 19, Clerk Authentication
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (existing)
**Testing**: TypeScript compilation + ESLint (existing pattern - no additional testing framework)
**Target Platform**: Web application (server-side rendering)
**Project Type**: Web application (single Next.js project)
**Performance Goals**: No performance degradation - page load times must remain unchanged
**Constraints**: Zero downtime, zero breaking changes, all existing URLs must continue working, strict TypeScript compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Focuses on shell route group elimination only, affects 7 major route sections

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Gates from PRIMA Constitution

**Patient-Centered Design (I)**: ✅ PASS - This change improves maintainability which indirectly benefits patient care by reducing bugs and improving development velocity. No impact to patient-facing functionality.

**Data Privacy and Compliance (II)**: ✅ PASS - Authentication and authorization logic will be preserved exactly as before. No changes to data access patterns.

**Reliability and Redundancy (III)**: ✅ PASS - Simplified routing structure improves reliability; fewer nested components reduce potential failure points.

**WIB Timezone Integrity (IV)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to timezone handling logic.

**Service Layer Architecture (V)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to service layer organization; this is purely a routing structure change.

**Type Safety and Validation (VI)**: ✅ PASS - Explicit focus on maintaining TypeScript strict mode compliance throughout migration.

**Performance with Caching (VII)**: ✅ PASS - No changes to caching strategies; simplified routing may improve performance slightly.

### GATE STATUS: ✅ PASSED
All constitution requirements satisfied with explicit TypeScript strict mode compliance focus.

**Structure Decision**: Single project with simplified routing structure. Focus on complete elimination of (shell) route group with preserved functionality.

## Complexity Tracking

This feature involves low complexity with clear scope boundaries:

| Aspect | Complexity | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| File movement | Low | Established Next.js patterns, direct directory moves |
| TypeScript compliance | Low | Explicit validation steps, strict mode enforcement |
| Import updates | Medium | Systematic update of all import statements |
| Layout preservation | Low | Maintain existing AuthLoading and error boundary patterns |

**Risk Assessment**: LOW RISK - Well-established Next.js patterns with clear success criteria.
