# Feature Specification: Refine Shell Route Group Specification

**Feature Branch**: `002-refine-shell-route`
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refine shell route group specification based on analysis feedback"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Shell Route Elimination (Priority: P1)

Users and developers will experience a simplified routing structure where all content previously under the (shell) route group is moved directly to the app/ directory, eliminating route group complexity while maintaining all existing URLs and functionality.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement that directly addresses the user's goal of moving everything from (shell) to directly under app/.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that no (shell) route group exists and all previously shell-contained routes work identically under their new direct paths.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any route previously under app/(shell)/*, **When** accessed directly under app/*, **Then** it should function exactly as before
2. **Given** the (shell) directory no longer exists, **When** users navigate to any authenticated route, **Then** they should see the same content and behavior as before
3. **Given** a developer examines the file structure, **When** they look for route groups, **Then** they should find no (shell) route group anywhere in the app directory
4. **Given** existing bookmarks and links, **When** users access them, **Then** all URLs should continue working without any changes

### User Story 2 - TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance (Priority: P1)

The codebase will maintain full TypeScript strict mode compliance throughout the migration process, ensuring no introduction of `any` types or violation of strict typing requirements.

**Why this priority**: Constitution Principle VI requires strict type safety for healthcare system reliability.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by running TypeScript compilation with strict mode and ensuring zero errors before and after migration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** TypeScript strict mode is enabled, **When** compilation runs after migration, **Then** zero errors should be reported
2. **Given** the codebase before migration, **When** strict mode compilation is run, **Then** the same error count should exist after migration (ideally zero)
3. **Given** any new code created during migration, **When** reviewed, **Then** it should use explicit types and never `any`

---

### User Story 3 - Simplified Development Workflow (Priority: P2)

Developers will experience a more intuitive file structure where the direct relationship between URLs and file paths is immediately obvious, reducing cognitive overhead when working with routing.

**Why this priority**: Improves developer experience and reduces learning curve for team members.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by having a developer navigate the file structure and confirm the URL-to-file mapping is intuitive without requiring knowledge of route groups.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a URL like /admin/users, **When** a developer looks at the file structure, **Then** they should immediately find the corresponding file at app/admin/users/page.tsx
2. **Given** a new developer joining the team, **When** they examine the routing structure, **Then** they should understand the pattern without needing explanation about route groups
3. **Given** the need to create a new route, **When** a developer adds it, **Then** they should follow a simple pattern without considering route group placement

### Edge Cases

- What happens to any relative import paths that reference the (shell) directory structure?
- How are dynamic imports or lazy loading that reference shell routes handled?
- What happens to middleware configurations that might reference route group patterns?
- How are any build or deployment scripts that reference the shell structure updated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The (shell) route group directory MUST be completely removed from src/app/
- **FR-002**: All content previously in src/app/(shell)/* MUST be moved to src/app/* maintaining the same relative structure
- **FR-003**: All existing URLs MUST continue working exactly as before with no changes
- **FR-004**: Authentication and authorization MUST continue working identically after migration
- **FR-005**: TypeScript strict mode MUST be maintained with zero compilation errors
- **FR-006**: All import statements MUST be updated to reflect the new file structure
- **FR-007**: Layout functionality MUST be preserved in the new structure
- **FR-008**: Error boundaries and loading states MUST continue working as before

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Shell Route Group**: The src/app/(shell) directory to be completely eliminated
- **Route Contents**: All directories and files currently under (shell) that will be moved directly to app/
- **Import References**: Any code that imports from shell-based paths that needs updating
- **Layout Components**: Authentication and error handling layouts that must be redistributed

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% elimination of (shell) route group - src/app/(shell) directory no longer exists
- **SC-002**: 100% of routes previously under (shell) function identically under direct app/ paths
- **SC-003**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors in strict mode both before and after migration
- **SC-004**: 100% URL preservation - all existing bookmarks and links continue working
- **SC-005**: 100% authentication flow preservation - login/logout functionality identical
- **SC-006**: Development time improvement measured as immediate understanding of URL-to-file mapping without route group explanation
- **SC-007**: Code simplification measured as zero references to route groups in documentation or code comments
