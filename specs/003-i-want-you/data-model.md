# Data Model: Remove Testing Infrastructure

**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Complete
**Note**: This feature removes infrastructure and does not introduce new data models or database changes.

## Data Model Impact

### No Database Changes

This feature does not involve any database schema modifications, new tables, or data migrations. The removal of testing infrastructure does not affect the application's persistent data storage.

### No New Entities

No new business entities or data structures are introduced by this feature. The focus is solely on removing existing testing-related files and configurations.

### File System Changes

The following file system artifacts will be removed:

```
Files to Remove:
├── coverage/                    # Directory (16MB)
│   ├── *.html                  # Coverage report files
│   ├── *.js                    # Coverage JavaScript files
│   ├── *.css                   # Coverage stylesheets
│   └── coverage-final.json     # Coverage data
├── vitest.config.ts           # Test configuration
└── scripts/
    ├── test-cms-api.ts        # Test utility script
    ├── test-cms-fix.ts        # Test utility script
    ├── test-consolidated-webhook.ts  # Test utility script
    └── test-simple-confirmation.ts   # Test utility script
```

### Configuration Changes

**package.json modifications:**

Scripts to remove:
- `"test": "vitest"`
- `"test:ui": "vitest --ui"`
- `"test:run": "vitest run"`
- `"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"`

DevDependencies to remove:
- `"@vitest/coverage-v8": "^3.2.4"`
- `"@vitest/ui": "^3.2.4"`
- `"vitest": "^3.2.4"`

## Validation Rules

### Build Verification
After removal, the following commands must succeed:
- `bun run build` - Next.js production build
- `bun run dev` - Development server startup
- `bun run lint` - ESLint validation
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation

### Performance Metrics
Expected improvements:
- Project size reduction: ~20MB
- npm install time reduction: 15%
- Zero test-related artifacts remaining

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- Git commit created before any removals
- Complete version history maintained
- `git revert` can restore all removed content

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Coverage folder completely removed
- [ ] vitest.config.ts removed
- [ ] All test scripts removed from scripts/
- [ ] Test npm scripts removed from package.json
- [ ] Test devDependencies removed from package.json
- [ ] CI/CD files scanned for test references
- [ ] Build process succeeds
- [ ] Development server starts
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] ESLint runs without errors

## Conclusion

This feature involves infrastructure cleanup only, with no data model changes or database impact. All changes are reversible through standard Git operations.
