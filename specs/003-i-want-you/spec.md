# Feature Specification: Remove Testing Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-want-you`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want you to remove the /coverage folder in my understanding from reading .env, that folder is for testing fully remove any other testing as well currently we do not need to test anything"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Remove Coverage Artifacts (Priority: P1)

As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want to remove all testing-related artifacts and infrastructure so that the project is streamlined without testing overhead.

**Why this priority**: Removing testing infrastructure reduces project complexity, eliminates maintenance burden, and removes unused dependencies that add no value to the current development workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all test-related files, folders, and configurations are removed and the project still builds and runs successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project contains a `/coverage` folder, **When** the removal process is executed, **Then** the folder is completely deleted from the filesystem
2. **Given** the project contains test-related configuration files, **When** the removal process is executed, **Then** all test configuration files are removed
3. **Given** the project contains test-related npm scripts, **When** the removal process is executed, **Then** all test scripts are removed from package.json
4. **Given** the project contains test-related dependencies, **When** the removal process is executed, **Then** all testing dependencies are removed from package.json
5. **Given** the project contains test utility scripts, **When** the removal process is executed, **Then** all test utility scripts are removed from the scripts directory

### User Story 2 - Verify Project Functionality (Priority: P2)

As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want to ensure that removing testing infrastructure does not break any existing functionality so that the application continues to work properly.

**Why this priority**: This is critical to ensure that the removal process doesn't introduce regressions or break the application build/deployment process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the build process and verifying the application starts successfully after test infrastructure removal.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all testing infrastructure has been removed, **When** running `bun run build`, **Then** the build completes successfully without errors
2. **Given** all testing infrastructure has been removed, **When** running `bun run dev`, **Then** the development server starts successfully
3. **Given** all testing infrastructure has been removed, **When** running `bun run lint`, **Then** linting completes successfully
4. **Given** all testing infrastructure has been removed, **When** running `bunx tsc --noEmit`, **Then** TypeScript compilation completes without type errors

### Edge Cases

- System handles dependencies that might be indirectly used by other parts of the application

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: CI/CD pipeline integration approach for testing references? → A: Remove all testing references from CI/CD files
- Q: Rollback strategy if removal causes issues? → A: Create git commit before removal for easy rollback
- Q: Dependency conflict resolution approach? → A: Remove all test dependencies regardless of conflicts

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST remove the `/coverage` folder and all its contents from the project root
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove the `vitest.config.ts` configuration file from the project root
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove all test-related npm scripts from package.json (test, test:ui, test:run, test:coverage)
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove all testing-related devDependencies from package.json (@vitest/coverage-v8, @vitest/ui, vitest)
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove all test utility scripts from the scripts directory (test-cms-api.ts, test-cms-fix.ts, test-consolidated-webhook.ts, test-simple-confirmation.ts)
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove all testing references from CI/CD pipeline files
- **FR-007**: System MUST create git commit before removal for easy rollback if issues occur
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure the project builds successfully after testing infrastructure removal
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure the development server starts successfully after testing infrastructure removal
- **FR-010**: System MUST remove all test dependencies regardless of conflicts with other dependencies

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Testing Infrastructure**: All files, folders, configurations, and dependencies related to testing functionality
- **Build Configuration**: package.json scripts and dependencies that affect the build process
- **Development Environment**: Configuration files and scripts that enable development workflows

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Project size reduced by at least 20MB (from coverage folder removal and dependency reduction)
- **SC-002**: npm install time reduced by 15% (from fewer dependencies)
- **SC-003**: package.json contains 0 test-related scripts and 0 testing dependencies
- **SC-004**: 100% of testing-related files and folders removed from the project
- **SC-005**: Build process completes in under 2 minutes after testing infrastructure removal
- **SC-006**: Development server starts within 30 seconds after testing infrastructure removal
