# Tasks: Remove Testing Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-i-want-you/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No tests requested - feature focuses on infrastructure removal only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create rollback commit before any removals (FR-007)
- [ ] T002 [P] Verify current project state and backup critical configurations

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T003 [P] Scan and identify all CI/CD files that may contain testing references (research finding)
- [ ] T004 Document all testing infrastructure locations and dependencies (research validation)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Remove Coverage Artifacts (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Remove all testing-related artifacts and infrastructure from the project

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all test-related files, folders, and configurations are removed and the project still builds and runs successfully

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T005 [US1] Remove coverage directory and all contents from project root (FR-001)
- [ ] T006 [US1] Remove vitest.config.ts configuration file from project root (FR-002)
- [ ] T007 [US1] [P] Remove test-cms-api.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)
- [ ] T008 [US1] [P] Remove test-cms-fix.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)
- [ ] T009 [US1] [P] Remove test-consolidated-webhook.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)
- [ ] T010 [US1] [P] Remove test-simple-confirmation.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)
- [ ] T011 [US1] Remove test-related npm scripts from package.json (FR-003)
- [ ] T012 [US1] Remove testing-related devDependencies from package.json (FR-004, FR-010)
- [ ] T013 [US1] Remove all testing references from CI/CD pipeline files (FR-006)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Verify Project Functionality (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure that removing testing infrastructure does not break any existing functionality

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the build process and verifying the application starts successfully after test infrastructure removal

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T014 [US2] Verify project builds successfully after testing infrastructure removal (FR-008)
- [ ] T015 [US2] Verify development server starts successfully after testing infrastructure removal (FR-009)
- [ ] T016 [US2] Verify linting completes successfully after testing infrastructure removal
- [ ] T017 [US2] Verify TypeScript compilation completes successfully after testing infrastructure removal
- [ ] T018 [US2] [P] Measure project size reduction to validate 20MB target (SC-001)
- [ ] T019 [US2] [P] Measure npm install time reduction to validate 15% target (SC-002)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T020 [P] Final validation of zero test-related artifacts in project (SC-004)
- [ ] T021 [P] Documentation updates reflecting testing infrastructure removal
- [ ] T022 [P] Clean up any remaining test-related references in documentation
- [ ] T023 [P] Update project README or setup instructions if needed
- [ ] T024 Create final commit with all testing infrastructure removal changes

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Depends on User Story 1 completion - Must verify after removal is complete
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Primary removal work
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after User Story 1 - Verification and validation work

### Within Each User Story

- Script removal tasks (T007-T010) marked [P] can run in parallel
- Performance measurement tasks (T018-T019) marked [P] can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks (T021-T023) marked [P] can run in parallel
- Other tasks are sequential due to dependencies

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Script removal tasks within User Story 1 can run in parallel
- Performance measurement tasks within User Story 2 can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks in Polish phase can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all script removal tasks together:
Task: "Remove test-cms-api.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)"
Task: "Remove test-cms-fix.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)"
Task: "Remove test-consolidated-webhook.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)"
Task: "Remove test-simple-confirmation.ts script from scripts/ directory (FR-005)"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Remove all testing infrastructure
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify all testing artifacts are removed
5. Proceed to User Story 2 if verification passes

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Remove all testing infrastructure ‚Üí Verify
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Verify functionality and measure improvements
4. Complete Polish ‚Üí Documentation and final cleanup

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (parallel script removals)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (verification tasks)
3. Stories complete and verification results integrated

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US2 but should be independently testable
  - User Story 2 (P2): Depends on User Story 1 - Must verify after removal complete
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - Verification work

### Within Each User Story

- Script removal tasks within US1 can run in parallel if staffed
- Performance measurement tasks within US2 can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks in Polish phase can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Script removal tasks within User Story 1 marked [P] can run in parallel
- Performance measurement tasks within User Story 2 marked [P] can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks in Polish phase marked [P] can run in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- This is a cleanup/infrastructure removal feature - no new functionality to implement
- Success criteria focus on verification that nothing is broken after removal
- Risk mitigation through rollback commit and verification steps
- All removal operations use Bun commands only (constitutional compliance)

---

## Risk Mitigation

- **Rollback Safety**: T001 creates commit before any removals
- **Build Verification**: T014 ensures build process still works
- **Development Verification**: T015 ensures dev server still starts
- **Performance Validation**: T018-T019 measure expected improvements
- **Complete Removal**: T020 ensures zero test artifacts remain

---

## Success Criteria Validation

Each task includes references to functional requirements (FR-XXX) and success criteria (SC-XXX) to ensure complete coverage of the specification requirements.
